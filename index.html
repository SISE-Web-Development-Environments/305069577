  <h2>Web Q&A</h2>
  <ul>
    <br>
        <h3>Three main differents between web 1,2 and 3:</h3>
                <ul>
      <br>     
            <li>
              Web 1 - It is the “readable” phrase of the World Wide Web with flat data. In Web 1, there is only limited interaction between sites and web users. Web 1 is simply an information portal where users passively receive information without being given the opportunity to post reviews, comments, and feedback.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Web 2 - It is the “writable” phrase of the World Wide Web with interactive data. Unlike Web 1, Web 2 facilitates interaction between web users and sites, so it allows users to interact more freely with each other. Web 2 encourages participation, collaboration, and information sharing. Examples of Web 2 applications are Youtube, Wiki, Flickr, Facebook, and so on.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Web 3 - It is the “executable” phrase of Word Wide Web with dynamic applications, interactive services, and “machine-to-machine” interaction. Web 3 is a semantic web which refers to the future. In Web 3, computers can interpret information like humans and intelligently generate and distribute useful content tailored to the needs of users. The Web 3 is the web version which we are using now-days.</li>
            <br>
          </ul>
          <hr>
          <h3>Find Side effects of drugs, Use Cases(Web 1,2 and 3):</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Web 1 -  The user only has the ability to view everything that pharmaceutical companies have decided to upload to their website. They will probably enter their customer service phone number on the site and the user will need to call and inquire about the side effects. He will also need to know their URL. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Web 2 - The user can search for a particular drug and check the side effects of that drug. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Web 3 - The user could search "drug(name of drug) side effects" and after a number of searches on the site he will find the appropriate site for him. After logging in to the site, the relevant information will be displayed to him.</li>
                    </ul>
